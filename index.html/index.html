<li><h2><u>History of c language</u></h2></li>
 
The c language was developed by the <b>dennis ritchie</b> in 1972 .The c language is used for the desinging of the compilers like .... we can code any program by using the c language.It is a middle level language.So it can interact with the both low level languages and high level languages.<p>The main purpose of develeping the c language was for the unix operating system.
Before the c language there was some languages are there, which are  <ul><li>ALOGOL60-1960</li><li> CPL-1963</li>
                                <li>BCPL-1967</li><li>B-1970</li><li>C-1972</li><li>ANSI-1989</li><li>C99-1999</li><li>C11-2011</li></ul>
These are the languages deveped from 1960 the language.The language ALOGOL60 was developed in the year 1960 to overcome alogol60 ,in 1963 they developed language called CPL like these the evolution of the program is upto C language developed by the dennis ritchie,but in this language also there were some drawbacks which are nothing but if we want to develop a program in c language we need to write more coding even for a small program.<p>To overcome this problem now a days we more languages called c++,java,python etc... and another disadvatage of c language is ,it is platform dependent so it is not possible run c programs in all operating system.
<li><h2><u>The basic structure of c program</h2></u></li>
<font color="blue" size="5">T</font>he basic structure for c is, it containns no of <u><b>headers,main,flower brakets,local variables,global variables,body of the code</b></u>

In the above we have the structure of the C,in the 
  <ol><li>header</li>the header always starts with a symbol "#" and '<' ,'>' to access any file we need mention the header files <p>eg:"#include"stdio.h"","#include"conio.h""
<li>global varaibles</li>the global varaibles are declared outside of the main.The global varaibles can access from anywhere of the code.
<li>main</li>Every program must and should contain one main.The main is indication to the system that where the program should  start from.If the program does not contain the main function  then the system could understand that where the program start from.
<li>Body</li>
The body starts with curly braces"{" and closed with "}" and in the body we write the statements like printf(""),scanf("").... <li>local varaibles</li>
which are declared inside of the main "int x;"
